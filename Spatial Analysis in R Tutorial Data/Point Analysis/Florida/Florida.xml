<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>Accuracy should meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:2,000,000 scale map, approximately +/- 1000 meters. In December 2003, the following Topolgy Rules were created and validated for the feature classes in the State and Water Management Districts feature dataset: Florida region must not overlap. Water Management Districts region must not overlap. Florida region must be covered by Florida boundary lines. Water Management Districts region must be covered by Water Management District boundary lines. The Cluster Tolerance was set at 0.005 meters. Any errors that were found were inspected and corrected using ArcMap 8.3.</horizpar>

<procdesc>The UNIX compressed file was downloaded from the DEP ftp site along with the associated metadata. The file was uncompressed using the UNIX uncompress command. The export file was imported using the ArcInfo IMPORT command. The fuzzy tolerance was set to .001 and polygon topology was created using the BUILD command. The coverage was projected from ALBERS to UTM using the PROJECT command with the projection parameters listed below. The BUILD command was then used to recreate polygon and create arc topology. The ArcInfo commands ADDITEM and DROPITEM were used to modify the polygon attribute table (PAT) and arc attribute table (AAT). The following item was dropped from the PAT: MINOR1. The REGIONDISSOLVE command was used to create a region subclass called STATE. The following projection file was used: INPUT PROJECTION ALBERS UNITS METERS DATUM HPGN PARAMETERS 24 0 0.000 31 30 0.000 ?84 0 0.000 24 0 0.000 400000.00000 0.00000 OUTPUT PROJECTION UTM ZONE 17 UNITS METERS DATUM HPGN PARAMETERS END</procdesc>

<procdesc>In November and December 2003, an enterprise geodatabase was designed and implemented. Coverages were converted into feature classes using ArcCatalog 8.3. The feature classes were created new in a feature dataset, with column names, shape type, grid size, and projection information defined during creation. An X/Y Domain and Precision were set at MinX: -700,000; MinY: 2,000,000; Precision: 1000. Z-Values were set at MinZ: -20; Precision: 1000. The Grid Tile Size is 2,147,483.465. Data was then loaded into the feature classes from the coverages using the 'Load Data' tool in ArcCatalog 8.3. Indexes were created for attributes when there were more than 100 records in the data set. Topology was validated whenever possible. See Positional Accuracy for topology rules used for positional validation.</procdesc>

<procdesc>In October 2009, the District's enterprise SDE vector data layers were re-projected from UTM to State Plane Feet. At this same time the data layers were loaded into SDE using ESRI's Spatial Data Type. The new data type allows users to use SQL queries for spatial inquiries.</procdesc>
